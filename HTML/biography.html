            <div class="content">
                <p>My name is Ty Hendershot. I really enjoy spending time making websites!
                    I've never thought myself as a programmer, however I simply fell in love with 
                    making websites! Although I've got a lot to learn, I am proud of what I'm able to do so far!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in Las Vegas and grew up most of my life in Utah. I have a family of three siblings. Two brothers and one sister who are all married 
                    and have kids!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm currently going to school at UVU and getting my degree in Computer Science. I would love to be able to 
                    make a career out of being either a web developer or a software developer.
                    Being able to employ the skills that I've learned through online courses, school classes, etc. would be
                    a very satisfying career path for me.

        <div class="content">
            
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                I really enjoy playing and listening to music! Ever since I was young my mom had me take piano lessons. As I grew up
                I would play the piano, guitar, clarinet, and saxophone. Today I mainly stick with playing the guitar. I enjoy playing 
                rock and roll, punk rock, or acoustic fingerpicking style every now and then. When I was in my first few years at College
                I even had a small band I'd play with. We ended up making a few songs of our own! However, 
                I don't have any plans on making this a career, however I do think it would be a great hobby to be able to play on the 
                weekends in local venues! 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            
            <h3>Motorcycles</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I remember my dad owning a motorcycle that he would take us out to ride on. He even
                purchased dirt bikes for us to go riding on dirt trails with, which was a ton of fun! I never thought about 
                buying my own streek bike, however I ended up making that decision when I was around 23 years old. I haven't 
                regretted that decision yet, I love to ride my motorcycle! Having a motorcycle to me is a lot of fun and brings me my zen in life!

                <h3>Traveler</h3>
                <p>Though I haven't traveled as much as some world explorers, I certainly do like to visit other cultures and countries. By far
                    France has been my favorite place that I have ever visited. There are many fantastic elements in France that I enjoy and love 
                    going back to experience.
